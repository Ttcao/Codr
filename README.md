# Codr

### Overview:

As part of the WDI course, the week 6 project was to build a full-stack application with Ruby Sinatra.

The brief of the project was to:

- Have at _least_ 2 models for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public

### What is Codr?
Codr is a Tindr-like application which connects companies who are looking to hire and developers who are looking for jobs. Developers sign up to Codr and showcase their best snippet of code. The developer's code snippet is then shown to companies and remains anonymous. Companies sign up and 'swipe' through the developers code. Developers who have a 'match' with a company have the option to contact the company.

### Technologies used:

Ruby, Ruby Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Atom (editor), debugger, iTerm, Git.

### Approach taken:

- Planned the models and the database relationships within the application
- Sketched wireframes and layout of the views
- Created the databases
- Created the route handlers and view pages

### Possible improvements:
- Include password validation and password resets
- Have the code snippets 'swipe' across the screen
